### 2. Customization <a name="customization"></a>

You can customize various aspects of the resume to suit your personal information and style preferences. Here's what you can modify:

- **Background Color**: You can change the background color of the resume by modifying the `background-color` property in the `<body>` tag.

- **Profile Image**: Replace the profile image (`imgs/45d6921cbc967f1e58dd80a8691b2016.jpg`) with your own photo. Adjust the `height`, `width`, and `border-radius` properties to fit your image.

- **Personal Information**: Update your job title, location, email, and phone number in the `<p>` tags following the relevant icons.

- **Skills and Languages**: Customize the skills and languages sections by updating the labels and progress bar values. The progress bars have `value` and `max` attributes you can adjust.

- **Work Experience and Education**: Modify the content in the "Work Experience" and "Education" sections to reflect your own experiences and educational background. You can adjust the company names, positions, dates, and descriptions.

### 3. Adding Your Content <a name="adding-your-content"></a>

To add your own content, simply edit the HTML file (`index.html`) with your information. You can follow the existing structure and replace the placeholder text and images with your own details.

- Add your own profile picture to the `imgs/` directory and update the image source in the HTML.

### 4. Preview <a name="preview"></a>

Before publishing your resume, make sure to preview it in a web browser to ensure everything looks as expected. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see how your resume will appear to others.
